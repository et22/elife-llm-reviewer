elife-97674-v1,"This study investigates the role of GPR156 in hair cell orientation and its implications for vestibular function in mouse and zebrafish models. The evidence presented is compelling, demonstrating important molecular mechanisms, although the focus on specific models may limit the broader applicability of the findings. This work is significant for researchers in sensory biology and vestibular neuroscience.",Important,Convincing,"The authors explore the contributions of GPR156 to hair cell orientation in mouse otolith organs and zebrafish neuromasts. They find that while GPR156 is essential for maintaining mechanotransduction properties in zebrafish, it does not affect the anatomical organization or physiological properties of hair cells in mice, indicating distinct roles across species.","['The comprehensive approach, integrating genetic, anatomical, and physiological analyses across two model organisms, strengthens the conclusions drawn.', 'The study identifies specific roles for GPR156 in hair cell orientation and mechanotransduction, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of vestibular function.', 'Data presentation is clear, with well-defined experimental methods and appropriate statistical analyses.']","['The study primarily focuses on mouse and zebrafish, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other species, including humans.', 'The authors could further discuss the potential implications of their findings on vestibular function in broader biological contexts, as well as the limitations of their models.']","The authors successfully demonstrate the role of GPR156 in hair cell orientation and its downstream effects on vestibular function. While the results are robust, additional exploration of the implications for other species could enhance the impact of the work.","This study enhances our understanding of vestibular biology and the molecular mechanisms underlying sensory function, potentially informing future research in sensory disorders and vestibular dysfunction.","While this research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of hair cell orientation and vestibular function, exploring these findings in additional model organisms could help clarify their broader relevance."
