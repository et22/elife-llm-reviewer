TITLE
Interchromosomal segmental duplication drives translocation and loss of P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 3

ABSTRACT
Most malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detect Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) and PfHRP3, but deletions of pfhrp2 and phfrp3 genes make parasites undetectable by RDTs. We analyzed 19,313 public whole-genome-sequenced P. falciparum field samples to understand these deletions better. Pfhrp2 deletion only occurred by chromosomal breakage with subsequent telomere healing. Pfhrp3 deletions involved loss from pfhrp3 to the telomere and showed three patterns: no other associated rearrangement with evidence of telomere healing at breakpoint (Asia; Pattern 13-TARE1); associated with duplication of a chromosome 5 segment containing multidrug-resistant-1 gene (Asia; Pattern 13-5++); and most commonly, associated with duplication of a chromosome 11 segment (Americas/Africa; Pattern 13-11++). We confirmed a 13â€“11 hybrid chromosome with long-read sequencing, consistent with a translocation product arising from recombination between large interchromosomal ribosome-containing segmental duplications. Within most 13-11++ parasites, the duplicated chromosome 11 segments were identical. Across parasites, multiple distinct haplotype groupings were consistent with emergence due to clonal expansion of progeny from intrastrain meiotic recombination. Together, these observations suggest negative selection normally removes 13-11++pfhrp3 deletions, and specific conditions are needed for their emergence and spread including low transmission, findings that can help refine surveillance strategies.

INTRODUCTION
P. falciparum malaria remains a leading cause of childhood mortality in Africa
Plasmodium falciparum remains one of the most common causes of malaria and childhood mortality in Africa despite significant efforts to eradicate the disease (WHO, 2022). The latest report by the World Health Organization estimated 247 million cases of malaria and 619,000 fatalities in 2021 alone, with the vast majority of deaths occurring in Africa (WHO, 2022).
The mainstay of malaria diagnosis across Africa is no longer microscopy but rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) due to their simplicity and speed. Their swift adoption, now totaling hundreds of millions a year, coupled with effective artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) has led to significant progress in malaria control (Chiodini, 2014; Poti et al., 2020). The predominant and most sensitive falciparum malaria RDTs detect PfHRP2 and, to a lesser extent, its paralog PfHRP3 due to cross-reactivity.

Increasing numbers of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3-deleted parasites escaping diagnosis by RDTs
Unfortunately, a growing number of studies have reported laboratory and field isolates with deletions of pfhrp2 (PF3D7_0831800) and pfhrp3 (PF3D7_1372200) in the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes 8 and 13, respectively. The resulting lack of these proteins allows the parasite to fully escape diagnosis by PfHRP2-based RDTs (Baker et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2014; Organization WH, 2011; Poti et al., 2020; Thomson et al., 2020). Pfhrp2/3-deleted parasites appear to be spreading rapidly in some regions and have compromised existing test-and-treat programs, especially in the Horn of Africa (Berhane et al., 2018; Feleke et al., 2021; Verma et al., 2018; WHO, 2020). The prevalence of parasites with pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletion varies markedly across continents and regions in a manner not explained by RDT use alone. Parasites with these deletions are well-established in areas where PfHRP2-based RDTs have never been used routinely, such as parts of South America (Thomson et al., 2020). Studies in Ethiopia, where false-negative RDTs owing to pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions are common, suggest that the pfhrp3 deletion arose first, given it is more prevalent and shows a shorter shared haplotype (Feleke et al., 2021). The reason why pfhrp3 deletion occurred prior to pfhrp2 remains unclear. A 1994 study of the HB3 laboratory strain reported frequent meiotic translocation of a pfhrp3 deletion from chromosomes 13 to 11 (Hinterberg et al., 1994). An explanation of this mechanism, whether it might occur in natural populations, and how it relates to the initial loss of pfhrp3 has not been fully explored.

Precise pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletion mechanisms remain unknown
Studies of P. falciparum structural rearrangements are challenging, and pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions are particularly difficult due to their position in complex subtelomeric regions. Subtelomeric regions represent roughly 5% of the genome, are unstable, and contain rapidly diversifying gene families (e.g. var, rifin, stevor) that undergo frequent conversion between chromosomes mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) and double-stranded breakage (DSB) and telomere healing (Calhoun et al., 2017; Gardner et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2014; Mattei and Scherf, 1994; Reed et al., 2021; Vernick and McCutchan, 1988; Zhang et al., 2019). Subtelomeric exchange importantly allows for unbalanced progeny without the usual deleterious ramifications of altering a larger proportion of a chromosome. Notably, newly formed duplications predispose to further duplications or other rearrangements through NAHR between highly identical paralogous regions. Together, this potentiates the rapid expansion of gene families and their spread across subtelomeric regions (Conrad et al., 2010; Didelot et al., 2012; Kidd et al., 2010; Korbel et al., 2007; Mills et al., 2011; Parks et al., 2015). The duplicative transposition of a subtelomeric region of one chromosome onto another chromosome frequently occurs in P. falciparum. Specifically, prior studies have found duplicative transposition events involving several genes, including var2csa and cytochrome b (Bopp et al., 2013; Claessens et al., 2014; Sander et al., 2014; Sander et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2019). Notably, pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 are adjacent to but not considered part of the subtelomeric regions, and recombination of var genes does not result in the deletion of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 (Feleke et al., 2021; Otto et al., 2018a).
Telomere healing, de novo telomere addition via telomerase activity, is associated with subtelomeric deletion events in P. falciparum that involve chromosomal breakage and loss of all downstream genes. Healing serves to stabilize the end of the chromosome. Deletion of the P. falciparum knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP or pfhrp1) and pfhrp2 genes via this mechanism was first reported to occur in laboratory isolates (Pologe and Ravetch, 1988). Since then, studies have defined the critical role of telomerase in P. falciparum and additional occurrences affecting several genes, including pfhrp1, Pf332, and Pf87 in laboratory isolates (Bottius et al., 1998; Mattei and Scherf, 1994; Scherf and Mattei, 1992). For pfhrp1 and pfhrp2, this deletion mechanism only occurred in laboratory isolates but not in clinical samples, suggesting the genes have important roles in normal infections, and their loss is selected against (Scherf and Mattei, 1992).
An improved understanding of the patterns and mechanisms of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions can provide important insights into how frequently they occur and the evolutionary pressures driving their emergence and help inform control strategies. We examined the pattern and nature of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions using available whole-genome sequences and additional long-read sequencing. The objectives of this study were to determine the pfhrp3 deletion patterns along with their geographical associations and sequence and assemble the chromosomes containing the deletions using long-read sequencing. Our findings shed light on geographical differences in pfhrp3 deletion patterns, their mechanisms, and how they likely emerged, providing key information for improved surveillance.


RESULTS
Pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions in the global P. falciparum genomic dataset
We examined all publicly available Illumina whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from global P. falciparum isolates as of January 2023, comprising 19,313 field samples and lab isolates (Supplementary file 1). We analyzed the genomic regions containing pfhrp2 on chromosome 8 and pfhrp3 on chromosome 13 to detect nucleotide and copy number variation (e.g. deletions and duplications) using local haplotype assembly and sequencing depth. Regions on chromosomes 5 and 11 associated with these duplicates were also analyzed based on associations with patterns seen within chromosomes 8 and 13 (Supplementary file 2, Supplementary file 3, Methods). Samples were eliminated for downstream analysis if they had less than 5 x median genomic coverage and selective whole genome amplification (sWGA) samples with significant variability on visible inspection. This resulted in 3321 samples being eliminated, leaving 15,992 samples for further analysis. We removed six samples that showed signs of deletions but also had a complexity of infection (COI) greater than 1 to eliminate any artifact introduced by mixed infections from downstream analysis. We identified 26 parasites with pfhrp2 deletion and 168 with pfhrp3 deletion. Twenty field samples contained both deletions; 11 were found in Ethiopia, six in Peru, and three in Brazil, and all had the 13-11++ pfhrp3 deletion pattern. Across all regions, pfhrp3 deletions were more common than pfhrp2 deletions; specifically, pfhrp3 deletions and pfhrp2 deletions were present in Africa in 42 and 11, Asia in 51 and 3, and South America in 75 and 11 parasites. It should be noted that these numbers are not accurate measures of prevalence, given that the publicly available WGS specimens utilized in this analysis come from locations and time periods that commonly used RDT positivity for collection. Furthermore, subtelomeric regions are difficult to sequence and assemble, meaning these numbers may be significantly underestimated.

Pfhrp2 deletion associated with variable breakpoints and telomeric healing
We further examined the breakpoints of 26 parasites (24 patient parasites and two lab isolates) (Figure 1â€”figure supplement 1). Twelve parasites showed evidence of breakage and telomeric healing as suggested by telomere-associated tandem repeat 1 (TARE1) (Vernick and McCutchan, 1988) sequence contiguous with the genomic sequence at locations where coverage drops to zero (Figure 1â€”figure supplement 2). Most breakpoints occur within pfhrp2, found in 9 South American parasites and lab isolate D10 (Figure 1â€”figure supplement 2). The other pfhrp2-deleted parasites did not have detectable TARE1 or evidence of genomic rearrangement but were amplified with sWGA, limiting the ability to detect the TARE1 sequence. Thus, pfhrp2 deletion likely occurs solely through breakage events with subsequent telomeric healing.

Three distinct pfhrp3 deletion patterns with geographical associations
Exploration of read depth revealed three distinct deletion copy number patterns associated with pfhrp3 deletion (chromosome 13: 2,840,236â€“2,842,840): first, sole deletion of chromosome 13 starting at various locations centromeric to pfhrp3 to the end of the chromosome with detectable TARE1 telomere healing and unassociated with other rearrangements (pattern 13-TARE1); second, deletion of chromosome 13 from position 2,835,587 to the end of the chromosome and associated with duplication of a chromosome 5 segment from position 952,668â€“979,203,, which includes pfmdr1 (pattern 13-5++); and third, deletion of chromosome 13 commencing just centromeric to pfhrp3 and extending to the end of the chromosome and associated with duplication of the chromosome 11 subtelomeric region (pattern 13-11++) (Figure 1). Among the 168 parasites with pfhrp3 deletion, 20 (11.9%) were pattern 13-TARE1, 28 (16.6%) were pattern 13-5++, and the majority with 120 (71.4%) demonstrated pattern 13-11++. Pattern 13-11++ was almost exclusively found in parasites from Africa (n=39) and the Americas (n=75), with six in Asia, while 13-5++ was only observed in Asia (Figure 1). As a result of our short-read analysis demonstrating these three patterns and discordant reads between the chromosomes involved, chromosomes 5, 11, and 13 were further examined. No other chromosomes had associated discordant reads or changes in read coverage.
Figure 1: Pfhrp2/3 deleted parasites with altered sequence coverage across regions of chromosomes 11, 13, and 5. Sequence coverage heatmap of pfhrp3 deletion associated regions of chromosomes 11 (1,897,151â€“2,003,328 bp), 13 (2,769,916â€“2,844,785 bp), and 5 (944,389â€“988,747 bp) in the 168 samples with evidence of pfhrp3 deletion out of the 19,313 publicly available samples. The regions from chromosomes 11 and 13 are at the end of their core region, while the region from chromosome 5 is the region around pfmdr1 involved in its duplication event. Each row is a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) sample, and each column is normalized coverage. The top annotation along chromosomes depicts the location of genes with relevant genes colored: rRNA (light pink), pf332 (red-orange), pfhrp3 (purple), pfmdr1 (electric-blue), and all other genes are colored light-blue. The second row delineates significant genomic regions: The chromosome 11/13 duplicated region (dark blue), the subtelomere regions of chr11/13 (orange), and the chromosome 5 duplicated region (fuchsia). The left annotation for samples includes the genomic rearrangement/deletion pattern (patterns with telomere-associated tandem repeat 1 (TARE1) have evidence of TARE1 addition following deletion), the continent of origin, and pfhrp2/3 deletion calls. Increased variation and biases in coverage correlate with P. falciparum selective whole-genome amplification (sWGA), which adds variance and biases to the sequence coverage before sequencing.

Sequence coverage heatmap of chromosomes 8 (1,290,239â€“1,387,982 bp), 11 (1,897,151â€“2,003,328 bp), 13 (2,769,916â€“2,844,785 bp). Displaying the 26 parasites out of the 19,313 samples with signs of possible pfhrp2 deletions. Each row is a parasite. The top annotation along chromosomes depicts the location of genes, and the second row delineates the duplicated region (dark blue) and subtelomere region (orange). The left parasite annotation includes the deletion pattern, continent of origin, and pfhrp2/3 deletion calls. The 20 parasites with evidence of HRP3 deletion were only found within South America (six in Peru, three in Brazil) and Africa (11 in Ethiopia) and had evidence of the 13-11++ deletion HRP3 deletion pattern. Of the 6 parasites without HRP3 deletion (marked as white in pfhrp3- Pattern column for having no pfhrp3 deletion), two were from South America,three from Asia (one being lab isolate DD2), and one from Oceania (lab isolate D10).

Heatmap coverage normalized to genomic coverage of the sub-telomeric region of chromosome 8 (spanning 1,365,360â€“1,375,435 bp, 10,075 bp in length) for the 26 parasites with pfhrp2 genomic deletion. Each row is a parasite, and each column is a genomic location. The top annotates which gene the region falls within. The right side annotation shows the country of origin and which parasites have evidence of at the location where genomic coverage (telomere-associated tandem repeat 1, TARE1) at the location where genomic coverage drops to zero within this region. Most parasites without evidence of TARE1 or other genomic rearrangement are selective whole genome amplification (sWGA) parasites and may lack the coverage to detect such events.

Heatmap coverage normalized to genomic coverage of the sub-telomeric region of chromosome 13 (spanning 2,817,793â€“2,844,785 bp, 26,992 bp in length) for the 48 parasites with pfhrp3 deletions not associated with pattern 13-11++. Each row is a parasite, and each column is a genomic location. The top annotates which gene the region falls within. The right side annotation shows which parasites have evidence of telomere-associated tandem repeat 1 (TARE1) at the location where genomic coverage drops to zero within this region (n=19 pattern 13-TARE) and which parasites have evidence of genomic rearrangement with chromosome 5 from discordant paired-end reads, which results in duplication of pfmdr1 (n=28 pattern 13-5++). The top parasite lacks evidence of either deletion type. The next 28 parasites have evidence of rearrangement with chromosome 5 with discordant reads with mates mapping to chromosome 13 and other mates mapping to chromosome 5. The next 19 parasites have evidence of TARE1 contiguous with chromosome 13 sequence on various locations consistent with breakage and telomere healing. These breaks occur on chromosome 13 at 2,836,793 (n=8), 2,830,793 (n=4), 2,829,793 (n=2), 2,821,793 (n=1), 2,822,793 (n=1), 2,833,793 (n=1), 2,834,793 (n=1), 2,836,793 (n=1), and 2,840,793 (n=1).
Figure 1â€”figure supplement 4: Coverage of chromosome 5 for parasites with pfhrp3 deletion pattern 13-TARE1 and 13-5++. Heatmap coverage normalized to genomic coverage of a region of chromosome 5 (spanning 944,534â€“988,747 bp, 44,213 bp in length) for parasites with pfhrp3 deletion pattern 13-TARE1. Each row is a parasite, and each column is a genomic location. The top annotates which gene the region falls within. The right side annotates the country of origin of the parasite. The third annotation bar on the right side shows which parasites have telomere-associated tandem repeat 1 (TARE1) detected on chromosome 13; parasites with green have TARE1 detected on chromosome 13 that are clustered on the bottom of the graph and have normal coverage across this region of chromosome 5, while the parasites on top have evidence of re-arrangement between chromosome 13 (position 2,835,587) and chromosome 5 (position 979,203) and show increased coverage across chromosome 5 up to the point where TARE1 sequence is detected on the reverse strand. The second annotation hot-pink bar from the top indicates the duplicated region. The beginning of this bar is where the TARE1 sequence on the reverse strand is detected. The above would be consistent with a genomic rearrangement between chromosome 13 at position 2,835,587 and chromosome 5 at position 979,203, which results in the deletion of chromosome 13 from 2,835,587 onwards and the duplication of a 26 KB region of the reverse strand of chromosome 5 from position 979,203â€“952,668 resulting in the duplication of pfmdr1 and the deletion of pfhrp3. The parasites with transposition evidence between 13 and 5 but no TARE1 detected on 5 were all sWGA parasites, which likely limited the ability to detect the TARE1 sequence. The top four parasites appear coverage-wise to have three copies of pfmdr1. The top four parasites, in addition to the likely copy on chromosome 13, have a tandem duplication on chromosome 5. There were two different tandem duplications detected. The first parasite is tandemly duplicated from a monomeric stretch of Ax19 at 947,967 and Ax18 at 970,043 and is from Laos. The second, third, and fourth parasites, all from Cambodia, are tandemly duplicated from Ax22 at chromosome 5 946,684 and Ax36 at 964,504. All parasites with evidence for 13-5++ have only wild-type pfmdr1 or are a mix of wild-type and 184 F. The four parasites with three copies of pfmdr1 have 2 x coverage of 184 F and 1 x coverage of wild-type pfmdr1, which is consistent with the duplicated pfmdr1 on chromosome 13 being wild-type pfmdr1. All parasites with this deletion pattern are found within Asia.
Figure 1â€”figure supplement 5: Chromosome 5 duplicated region microhaplotypes. The 22 microhaplotype regions with variation across the duplicated portion of chromosome 5 spanning from 952,668â€“979,203 for the 48 isolates with chromosome 13 deletion without chromosome 11 duplication. Each row is an isolate. In each column, the isolate is typed by microhaplotype (colored by the prevalence of each microhaplotype, with 1=red being most prevalent, 2=orange second most prevalent, and 3=blue least prevalent). This color coding system is specific to each column, and the same color across columns does not indicate the same haplotype, just the prevalence in the population for that column. Associated metadata for each isolate can be seen on the left after the isolateâ€™s name. Most (n=28) of these show evidence of complex recombination with chromosome 5 at 952,668 and 2,835,587 on chromosome 13, resulting in the deletion of pfhrp3 and the duplication of pfmdr1. Only 6 isolates with MDR duplication have no variation within pfmdr1. The other isolates have a wild type Y184 (yellow) on one copy and 184 F (red) on the other copy.
Figure 1â€”figure supplement 6: Whole genome identity by descent (IBD) between all parasites with a genomic deletion. Whole genomic IBD was calculated between all parasites within this study with a genomic deletion (on chromosome 8, 11, or 13) using hmmIBD and whole genome biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The fraction of sites in IBD between parasites was plotted above. The top and left side annotations are the same and contain the parasiteâ€™s country, region, and continent of origin. The annotation also has the deletion calls for pfhrp2/3, the deletion Pattern, and which chromosome 11 haplotype cluster the parasite belongs to. The parasites cluster strongly by continent and by subregion/country. The two South American parasites clustered within the African samples are lab isolates HB3 and Santa-Luca-Salvador-1.
Figure 1â€”figure supplement 7: Whole genome identity by descent (IBD) between pfhrp3 deletion pattern 13-5++ parasites. Whole genome IBD was calculated between pfhrp3 deletion pattern 13-5++ parasites using hmmIBD using whole genome biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The fraction of sites in IBD between parasites was plotted above. The top and left side annotations are the same and contain the parasiteâ€™s country, region, and continent of origin. Haplotypes do not appear like a clonal expansion of a parasite containing the 13â€“5 hybrid chromosome, and either multiple different events occurred to create this hybrid translocation, or it occurred once, and the hybrid 13â€“5 chromosome has been passed onto prodigies which have continued to undergo sexual recombination decreasing their whole genome IBD.

Pattern 13-TARE1 associated with telomere healing
The 20 parasites with pattern 13-TARE1 with no association with any other chromosome rearrangement had deletions of the core genome averaging 19 kb (range: 11â€“31 kb). Of these 13-TARE1 deletions, 19 out of 20 had detectable TARE1 (pattern 13-TARE) adjacent to the breakpoint, consistent with telomere healing (Figure 1â€”figure supplement 3).

Pattern 13-5++ associated with NAHR-mediated pfmdr1 duplication and subsequent telomere healing
The 28 parasites with deletion pattern 13-5++ had a consistent loss of 17.9 kb of chromosome 13 and a gain of 25 kb from chromosome 5. These isolates have evidence of a genomic rearrangement that involves a 26 bp AT di-nucleotide repeat at 2,835,587 on chromosome 13, and a 20 bp AT di-nucleotide repeat at 979,203 on chromosome 5. Analysis revealed paired-end reads with discordant mapping, with one read mapping to chromosome 13 and the other to chromosome 5. Reads assembled from these regions form a contig of a unique sequence that connects chromosome 13 (position 2,835,587) to chromosome 5 (position 979,203) in reverse orientation. Read depth coverage analysis revealed more than a twofold increase on chromosome 5 from 979,203â€“952,668,, with the TARE1 sequence contiguously extending from 952,668, consistent with telomere healing. This 25 kb duplication contained several genes, including intact PF3D7_0523000 (pfmdr1) (Figure 1â€”figure supplement 4 and Figure 1â€”figure supplement 5), and TARE1 transition occurred within the gene PF3D7_0522900 (a zinc finger gene). Further read depth, discordant read, and assembly analysis revealed four 13-5++ parasites that, in addition to the chromosome 5 segment duplication on chromosome 13, had the described pfmdr1 tandem duplication on chromosome 5 associated with drug resistance, resulting in over threefold read depth across pfmdr1 gene (Figure 1â€”figure supplement 4; Nair et al., 2007). The parasites containing this translocation do not appear to be a clonal expansion based on whole genome IBD (Figure 1â€”figure supplement 6, Figure 1â€”figure supplement 7), which suggests this event occurred multiple times with the same TARE1 healing point and chromosome 13/5 transition point or that it occurred once with this hybrid chromosome 13â€“5 being passed down to progeny during sexual recombination and maintained in further progeny thereafter.

Pattern 13-11++ predominated in the Americas and Africa
Pattern 13-11++ was observed in 75 American parasites, 39 African parasites, and 6 Asian parasites (Figure 1). Of the 120 parasites with this pfhrp3 deletion pattern, 96 (73 of the 75 American, 18 of 39 African parasites, and 5 of 6 Asian) had near-identical copies of the chromosome 11 duplicated region. Near-identical copies were defined as having â‰¥99% identity (same variant microhaplotype between copies) across 382 variant microhaplotypes (Supplementary file 3) within the duplicated region, far less than normal between parasite allelic differences. These 96 parasites containing identical copies did not all share the same overall haplotype but showed nine major haplotypes found in more than one sample and 14 haplotypes found only in one sample each (Figure 2, Figure 2â€”figure supplement 1). The remaining 22 parasites varied within this region; on average, 10.2% of variant sites differed between the copies (min 83.8% identity). Of these, three haplotypes were found in more than one sample (Figure 2, Figure 2â€”figure supplement 2). The different haplotypes showed geographical separation, with distinct haplotypes observed in American and African strains (Figure 2â€”figure supplement 3, Figure 2â€”figure supplement 4, Figure 2â€”figure supplement 5, Figure 2â€”figure supplement 2). The haplotypes for the segment of chromosome 11 found within 13-11++ parasites could also be found within the parasites lacking the 13-11++ translocation (Figure 2â€”figure supplement 5). The lab isolates with 13-11++ SD01 (Africa) and Santa-Luca-Salvador-1 (America) have perfect copies, while HB3 (America) has divergent copies (Figure 2â€”figure supplement 6).
Figure 2: Microhaplotype patterns for the duplicated portion of chromosome 11 in 13-11++ parasites form 11 distinct haplotype groups with a geographic distinction between Africa and the Americas. Each row represents a group of 13-11++ parasites based on shared haplotypes on the chromosome 11 duplicated segment. The number of parasites and continent of origin are on the left for each group. Each column is a different genomic region across the duplicated portion of chromosome 11. In each column, the microhaplotype is colored by the prevalence of each microhaplotype (named Microhaplotype Rank), with 1=red being the most prevalent, 2=orange being the second most prevalent, and so forth. If more than one microhaplotype for a parasite is present at a genomic location, its height is relative to within-parasite frequency. Only sites with microhaplotype variation are shown (n=202). Most parasites show singular haplotypes at variant positions despite two copies consistent with identical haplotypes in the group, and when there are multiple microhaplotypes, the relative frequencies are 50/50, consistent with two divergent copies. Overall, haplotype groups are markedly different, consistent with separate translocations emerging and spreading independently.

Subset of the parasites from Figure 2â€”figure supplement 4 for the parasites that have a perfect duplication of the chromosome 11 segment. There are clear divergent haplotypes (nine can be found in multiple samples, with the largest group being found in 28 samples) for the perfect duplications, consistent with the duplication event occurring multiple times and does not stem from a single event from which all parasites are descended.

Subset of the parasites from Figure 2â€”figure supplement 4 for the parasites that have divergent duplicates of the chromosome 11 segment. Several parasites have divergent chromosome 11 segments, but they share the same exact divergent copies with other parasites, which would be consistent with the coinheritance of the two divergent copies simultaneously. This could be consistent with parasites inheriting from previous duplication events involving divergent copies or meiotic recombination between parasites with two separate duplication events of disparate chromosome 11 segments, inheriting one chromosome 11 segment on chromosome 13 from parent 1 and a different chromosome 11 segment on chromosome 11 from parent 2.
Figure 2â€”figure supplement 3: Jaccard similarity between parasites for chromosome 11 duplicated segment for pfhrp3 deletion pattern 13-11++ parasites. This is an all-by-all distance matrix showing Jaccard similarity for the duplicated chromosome 11 segments between all parasites with pfhrp3 deletion pattern 13-11++. The parasitesâ€™ continent, region, and country are annotated on the sides of the heatmap, along with the pfhrp2/3 deletion calls and whether the chromosome 11 duplicated segment shows an identical haplotype across the chromosome 11 duplicated segment. There are clearly several different haplotypes within the duplicated chromosome 11 segment, and there does not appear to be one specific haplotype associated with the duplication. The haplotypes found in more than 1 sample are clustered into â€˜Chr11DupHapClustersâ€™ and colored in the annotation bar. Parasites group strongly by geographical location.

Plotted haplotype variation per sub-genomic regions across the duplicated chromosome 11 segment for the pfhrp3 pattern 13-11++ parasites. Across the x-axis are the genomic regions in genomic order, and the genomic region genes are colored on the bottom bar. Each genomic area is slightly different in size, and there is genomic space between each region, so the plot is not on a genomic scale. The y-axis is each parasite with pattern 13-11++ of pfhrp3 deletion where this segment of chromosome 11 is duplicated onto chromosome 13. The continent, region, and country are colored per parasite on the leftmost of the plot. Each column contains the haplotypes for that genomic region colored by the haplotype prevalence rank more prevalent have a lower rank number, with most prevalent having rank (1) at that window/column. Colors are by frequency rank of the haplotypes most prevalent haplotypes have rank 1 and colored red, second most prevalent haplotypes are rank 2 and colored orange, and so forth. Shared colors between columns do not mean they are the same haplotype. If the column is black, there is no variation at that genomic window. If there is more than one variant for a parasite at a genomic location, the barâ€™s height is the relative within-parasite frequency of that haplotype for that parasite. The parasites are in the same order as the heatmap dendrogram in Figure 2â€”figure supplement 3. There are clear, distinctive haplotypes for this duplicated region. The leftmost annotation bar shows which cluster (based on the sharing &gt;99% identity in this area) the parasite belongs to, which is named â€˜Chr11DupHapClusterâ€™.
Figure 2â€”figure supplement 5: Jaccard similarity for chromosome 11 duplicated segment. All parasites with micohaplotypes similar to the duplicated chromosome 11 microhaplotypes for the pfhrp3 deletion Pattern 13-11++ parasites. While similar to Figure 2â€”figure supplement 3, this all-by-all heatmap of Jaccard similarity includes all parasites with a similar chromosome segment to the parasites with pattern 13-11++ pfhrp3 deletions. For the side and top annotations of parasites that do not have chromosome 11 duplication, there is a white bar for whether or not they have perfect chromosome 11 duplication. There are many parasites with closely related chromosome 11 segments to the duplicated chromosome 11 segments, indicating that the duplicated chromosome 11 segments also circulate within the population in strains with normal chromosome 11 and 13 arrangements.

Subset of the parasites from Figure 2â€”figure supplement 4 but for SD01 and HB3, which were sequenced in this paper, and for Santa-Luca-Salvador-1, another lab isolate that shows similar pfhrp3 deletion pattern 13-11++. SD01 and Santa-Luca-Salvador-1 have perfect copies, while HB3 has divergent copies.

Pattern 13-11++ breakpoint occurs in a segmental duplication of ribosomal genes on chromosomes 11 and 13
Pattern 13-11++ has a centromeric breakpoint consistently occurring within a 15.2 kb interchromosomal segmental duplication on chromosomes 11 and 13 (Chr11-1918028-1933288 (bp = 15,274), Chr13-2792021-2807295 (bp = 15,260)). It was the largest duplication in the core genome based on an all-by-all unique k-mer genome comparison using nucmer (Kurtz et al., 2004; Supplementary file 5). The two copies on chromosome 11 and chromosome 13 in the reference genome were 99.0% identical (Figure 3) and oriented similarly. Each copy contained a centromeric 7 kb region encoding 2â€“3 undefined protein products (98.9% identity) and a telomeric 8 kb nearly identical region (99.7% identity) containing one of the two S-type (Gardner et al., 2002) ribosomal genes (S=sporozoite), which are primary expressed during life cycle stages in mosquito vector (Figure 3). Pairwise alignment of the chromosomes 11 and 13 paralogs showed similar allelic and paralogous identity levels. No consistent nucleotide differences were found between the paralogs, leading to no distinct separation between copies when clustered (Figure 3). This suggests ongoing interchromosomal exchanges or conversion events maintaining paralog homogeneity. There is less separation by continent in this region when clustering by the variation in this region compared to the duplicated chromosome 11 segment (Figure 3â€”figure supplement 1, Figure 3â€”figure supplement 2).
Figure 3: Characterization of the 15.2 kb segmental duplication containing ribosomal genes on chromosomes 11 and 13. (a) Alignment of 3D7 reference genome copies on chromosome 11 (1,918,028â€“1,933,288 bp) and chromosome 13 (2,792,021â€“2,807,295 bp). These two regions are 99.3% identical. The diagonal black bars show 100% conserved regions of at least 30 bp in length, representing 89.1% of the alignment. Gene annotation is colored. (b) Comparison by pairwise alignments of the duplicated copies from non-pfhrp3 deleted strains (Otto et al., 2018a) assemblies (n=10) does not show a discrete separation of the paralogs with copies intermixed (chromosome 11 in blue and 13 in red). All copies are â‰¥99.0% similar, with the number of variants between segments ranging from 55 to 133 with no clear separation by continent or chromosome.

An all-by-all distance matrix showing Jaccard similarity for the chromosome 11 and 13 duplicated region between all the parasites with pfhrp3 deletion pattern 13-11++. The top triangle is identical to the bottom triangle. Parasitesâ€™ continent, region, and country are annotated on the sides of the heatmap, as well as the pfhrp2/3 deletion calls and whether the chromosome 11 duplicated segment is a perfect copy. Sequences cluster loosely per geographic region, with similar sequences from the same country. However, parasites are not as strong separately by continent as for the duplicated chromosome 11 segment. Despite all parasites having duplicated chromosome 11 via this region, there are clearly different haplotype groups, consistent with multiple origins of this duplication event.
Figure 3â€”figure supplement 2: Chromosome 11/13 15.2 kb duplicated region for pfhrp3 deletion pattern 13-11++ parasites. Plotted microhaplotype variation across the region shared between all chromosomes 11 and 13. Across the x-axis are the genomic regions in genomic order, and the genomic region genes are colored on the bottom bar. The y-axis is each parasite with pattern 13-11++ of pfhrp3 deletion where this segment of chromosome 11 is duplicated onto chromosome 13. The continent, region, and country are colored per parasite on the left most of the plot. Each column contains the haplotypes for that genomic region colored by the haplotype prevalence rank more prevalent have a lower rank number, with most prevalent having rank (1) at that window/column. Colors are by frequency rank of the haplotypes most prevalent haplotypes have rank 1 and colored red, second most prevalent haplotypes are rank 2 and colored orange, and so forth. Shared colors between columns do not mean they are the same haplotype. If the column is black, there is no variation at that genomic window. If there is more than one variant for a parasite at a genomic location, the barâ€™s height is the relative within-parasite frequency of that microhaplotype for that parasite. Pattern 13-11++ is missing 46,323 bases from chromosome 13 (2,807,159â€“2,853,482) with a gain of 70,190 bases of chromosome 11 (1,933,138â€“2,003,328). Based on genomes that are assembled to the end of their telomeres (Otto et al., 2018a), an additional 17â€“84 kb is deleted from the paralogous sub-telomeric region on chromosome 13, and an additional 15â€“87 kb of the paralogous sub-telomeric region on chromosome 11 is duplicated.

Plots of the peri-telomere regions of chromosome 8 across all sequenced Laverania Genomes (Otto et al., 2018b). This regionâ€™s assembly is incomplete for most strains, and only Pf3d7 and the closest relative to falciparum, PPRFG01, contain hrp2, but they are in similar locations. The bottom x-axis shows the genomic distance from the starting point in each strain but there is significantly more core genome to the left of the starting point.

Plots of the peri-telomere regions of chromosome 11 across all sequenced Laverania Genomes (Otto et al., 2018b). Assembly of this region is incomplete for the majority of strains. Plots begin 25 kb before the rRNA loci on this region where the duplicated region between chromosomes 11 and 13 is. All assemblies of the strains that contain this region have this region shared between species and between chromosomes 11 and 13. The bottom x-axis shows the genomic distance from the starting point in each strain, but there is significantly more of the core genome to the left of the starting point.
Figure 3â€”figure supplement 5: Gene Annotations of Chromosome 13 of PacBio-assembled P. Laverania Genomes. Plots of the peri-telomere regions of chromosome 13 across all sequenced Laverania Genomes (Otto et al., 2018b). Assembly of this region is incomplete for the majority of strains. Plots begin 25 kb before the rRNA loci on this region where the duplicated region between chromosomes 11 and 13 is. All strain assemblies that contain this region have this region shared between species and between chromosomes 11 and 13. The bottom x-axis shows the genomic distance from the starting point in each strain, but there is significantly more of the core genome to the left of the starting point.
Figure 3â€”figure supplement 6: Gene annotations of chromosome 11 of PacBio-assembled genomes. The genomic annotations across the 3` telomeric regions of PacBio-assembled genomes (Otto et al., 2018a) across chromosome 11 with the telomere repetitive elements (TAREs) are also shown if present. The presence of TAREs suggests that the assembly has made its way to the chromosomeâ€™s sub-telomeric region (end). The previously published PacBio assembled genomes for SD01 and HB3 did not reach the TAREs for chromosome 11 and terminated in the segmental duplication. The absence of an assembled sub-telomeric region on chromosome 11 prevents a detailed analysis of the mechanism behind the deletion of pfhrp3. It is likely a result of the inability of the assembler and/or underlying PacBio reads to unambiguously traverse the segmental duplication and separate the duplicated chromosome 11 subtelomeric region sequence into two copies. The bottom x-axis shows the genomic distance from the starting point in each strain, but there is significantly more of the core genome to the left of the starting point.
Figure 3â€”figure supplement 7: Gene annotations of chromosome 13 of PacBio-assembled genomes. The genomic annotations across the 3` telomeric regions of PacBio-assembled genomes (Otto et al., 2018a) across chromosome 13 with the telomere repetitive elements (TAREs) are also shown if present. The presence of TAREs would suggest that the assembly has made its way all the way through the sub-telomeric region for the chromosome. The previously published PacBio-assembled genomes for SD01 and HB3 have sub-telomeric chromosome 11 sequences beginning after the segmental duplication, which suggests a translocation. Still, given the incompleteness of the chromosome 11 assembly in Figure 3â€”figure supplement 6, it cannot be determined if this is simply a misassembly or a true translocation. The bottom x-axis shows the genomic distance from the starting point in each strain, but there is significantly more of the core genome to the left of the starting point.

Ribosomal gene segmental duplication exists in closely related P. praefalciparum
To look at the conservation of the segmental duplication containing the ribosomal genes, we examined genomes of closely related Plasmodium parasites in the Laverania subgenus, which comprised P. falciparum and other Plasmodium spp found in African apes. The Plasmodium praefalciparum genome, which is P. falciparumâ€™s closest relative, having diverged about 50,000 years ago (Otto et al., 2018b), also contained similar S-type rRNA loci on chromosomes 11 and 13 and had a similar gene synteny to P. falciparum in these regions and the region on chromosome 8 neighboring pfhrp2 (Figure 3â€”figure supplement 3, Figure 3â€”figure supplement 4, and Figure 3â€”figure supplement 5). P. praefalciparum contained the 15.2 kb duplicated region on both chromosomes 11 and 13 and was 96.7% similar to the 3D7 duplicated region. Other Laverania genomes (Otto et al., 2018b) were not fully assembled within their subtelomeric regions.

Previous PacBio assemblies did not fully resolve chromosome 11 and 13 subtelomeres
Given pattern 13-11++ was suggestive of duplication-mediated recombination leading to translocation, we examined high-quality PacBio genome assemblies of SD01 from Sudan and HB3 from Honduras, both containing the pfhrp3 deletion. However, the Companion (Steinbiss et al., 2016) gene annotations of chromosome 11 (Otto et al., 2018a) showed that these strains were not fully assembled in the relevant regions (Figure 3â€”figure supplement 6 and Figure 3â€”figure supplement 7).

Combined analysis of additional Nanopore and PacBio reads confirmed a segmental duplicated region of the normal chromosome 11 and hybrid chromosome 13-11
To better examine the genome structure of pattern 13-11++, we whole-genome sequenced the 13-11++ isolates HB3 and SD01 with long-read Nanopore technology. We generated 7350 Mb and 645 Mb of data, representing an average coverage of 319 x and 29.3 x for HB3 and SD01, respectively. We combined our Nanopore data with the publicly available PacBio sequencing data and tested for the presence of hybrid chromosomes using a two-pronged approach: (1) mapping the long reads directly to normal and hybrid chromosome 11/13 constructs and (2) optimized de-novo assembly of the higher quality Nanopore long reads.
To directly map reads, we constructed 3D7-based representations of hybrid chromosomes 13â€“11 and 11â€“13 by joining the 3D7 chromosomal sequences at breakpoints in the middle of the segmental duplication (Methods). We then used minimap2 (Li, 2018), width default settings, to align all PacBio and Nanopore reads for each isolate to the normal and hybrid constructs to detect reads completely spanning the duplicated region, extending at least 50 bp into flanking unique regions (Figure 4). HB3 had 77 spanning reads across normal chromosome 11 and 91 spanning reads across hybrid chromosome 13â€“11. SD01 had two chromosome 11 spanning reads and one 13â€“11 chromosome spanning read. SD01 had few spanning reads due to lower overall Nanopore reads secondary to insufficient input sample. Further analysis of SD01 revealed four regions within this duplicated region with chromosome 11 and 13-specific nucleotide variation, which was leveraged to further bridge this region for additional confirmation given SD01â€™s low coverage (Figure 4â€”figure supplement 1 and Figure 4â€”figure supplement 2). Neither isolate had long reads spanning normal chromosome 13 or hybrid 11â€“13, representing the reciprocal translocation product (Figure 4). Importantly, the other 12 isolates with intact pfhrp3 from the PacBio dataset (Otto et al., 2018a) all had reads consistent with normal chromosomes -- reads spanning chromosome 11 and chromosome 13 and no reads spanning the hybrid 13â€“11 or 11â€“13 chromosomes (Figure 4). Thus, long reads for HB3 and SD01 confirmed the presence of a hybrid 13â€“11 chromosome.
Figure 4: Long reads spanning the 15 kb duplicated region confirm the presence of translocated chromosome 13â€“11 in pfhrp3-deleted HB3 (Americas) and SD01 (Africa) but not pfhrp3-intact chromosomes. PacBio and Nanopore read &gt;15 kb for HB3, SD01, and CD01 are shown aligned to normal chromosomes 11 and 13 and hybrid chromosomes 11â€“13 and 13â€“11 constructed from the 3D7 sequence. Reads that completely span the segmental duplication (dark blue) anchoring in the unique flanking sequence are shown in maroon. Spanning reads are mapped only to this one location, whereas the non-spanning reads are mapped to both the hybrid or normal chromosomes as these chromosome segments are identical. SD01 and HB3 only have reads that span the duplicated region on chromosome 11, but no reads that span out of the duplicated region on chromosome 13. Instead, SD01 and HB3 have spanning reads across the hybrid chromosome 13â€“11. Other non-deleted isolates had spanning reads mapped solely to normal chromosomes, exemplified by CD01 (top row). No isolates had spanning reads across the hybrid 11â€“13 chromosome.

Subset of the parasites from Figure 3â€”figure supplement 2 but for SD01 and HB3, which were sequenced in this paper, and for Santa-Luca-Salvador-1, another lab isolate that shows similar pfhrp3 deletion pattern 13-11++. SD01 and Santa-Luca-Salvador-1 have perfect copies, but Santa-Luca-Salvador-1 has variation at 3 loci within the duplicated region, and SD01 has variation at 13 loci within this region. HB3 has divergent copies of the duplicated chromosome 11 segment and contains variation within this region.
Figure 4â€”figure supplement 2: Spanning PacBio and Nanopore Reads across the duplicated region for SD01. The spanning Nanopore and PacBio reads across chromosomes chr11 and chr13 duplicated regions for isolate SD01. The visualization truncates the reads if they span outside of the range shown. The left panel is chromosome 11, and the right panel is the hybrid chromosome 13â€“11. The chr11/13 duplicated region is colored in dark blue on the bottom of the plot, and the four loci where the isolate SD01 has key variation within this region, which can be used to optimize bridging across this duplicated region, are colored pink. The reads are colored by the chromosome associated with the variation seen in each read. The association was made by linking the variation found within each of the four loci and looking at the reads spanning from each chromosome to see which variants were associated with which chromosome. Each locus had two variants and had a strong association with each chromosome.

De novo long-read assemblies of pfhrp3-deleted strains further confirmed hybrid 13-11 chromosome
To further examine the parasites with hybrid 13â€“11 chromosomes and exclude potentially more complicated structural alterations involving other genome regions, de novo whole-genome assemblies were created for the HB3 and SD01 lab strains from Nanopore long reads. Assembly statistics were generated using the program quast (Gurevich et al., 2013) and the 3D7 reference genome. HB3 assembly yielded 16 contigs representing complete chromosomes (N50 1,5985,898 and L50 5). TARE-1 (Vernick and McCutchan, 1988) was detected on the ends of all chromosomes except for the 3â€™ end of chromosome 7 and the 5â€™ end of chromosome 5, indicating that telomere-to-telomere coverage had been achieved. SD01, with lower sequencing coverage, had a more disjointed assembly with 200 final contigs (N50 263,459 and L50 30). The HB3 and SD01 assemblies both had a chromosome 11 that closely matched normal 3D7 chromosome 11 and a separate hybrid 13â€“11 that closely matched 3D7 chromosome 13 until the ribosomal duplication region, where it then subsequently best-matched chromosome 11 (Figure 5, Figure 5â€”figure supplement 1). HB3â€™s 11 and hybrid 13â€“11 chromosomes had TARE-1 at their ends (Vernick and McCutchan, 1988), indicating that these chromosomes were complete. These new assemblies were further annotated for genes by Companion (Steinbiss et al., 2016). The contig matching the hybrid 13â€“11 for both strains essentially contained a duplicated portion of chromosome 11 telomeric to the ribosomal duplication. The duplicated genes within this segment included pf332 (PF3D7_1149000), two ring erythrocyte surface antigens genes (PF3D7_1149200, PF3D7_1149500), three PHISTs genes, a FIKK family gene, and two hypothetical proteins, and ends with a DnaJ gene (PF3D7_1149600) corresponding to 3D7 genes PF3D7_1148700 through PF3D7_1149600 (Figure 5â€”figure supplement 2 and Figure 5â€”figure supplement 3). Homology between HB3 chromosomes 11 and 13â€“11 continued up through a rifin, then a stevor gene, and then the sequence completely diverged in the most telomeric region with a different gene family organization structure, but both consisting of stevor, rifin, and var gene families along with other paralogous gene families (Figure 5â€”figure supplement 2). The chromosome 13â€“11 SD01 contig reached the DNAJ protein (PF3D7_1149600) and terminated (Figure 5â€”figure supplement 3), while normal 11 continued through two var genes and four rifin genes, likely because the assembly was unable to contend with the near complete identical sequence between the two chromosomes. Examination of the longer normal chromosome 11 portion revealed twofold coverage and no variation. Therefore, SD01 likely has identical chromosome 11 segments intact to the telomere of each chromosome.
Figure 5: A comparison of long-read assemblies of chromosomes 11 and 13 of HB3 and SD01 with the reference genome 3D7 confirms hybridized chromosomes 13â€“11. On top, chromosome 11 of HB3 and SD01 mapped entirely to the reference chromosome 11 of 3D7, with the segmental duplication region in dark blue mapped to both 11 and 13. The assembly of chromosome 13 of HB3 and SD01 maps to the reference chromosome 13 of 3D7 up through the segmentally duplicated region, but after the duplication (where pfhrp3 (green) should be found), it maps to chromosome 11 of 3D7 instead of chromosome 13. Red blocks mark telomere-associated repetitive elements (TARE) sequence. Displaying only from 50 kb upstream from the duplicated region to the end of the chromosomes. Chromosome 11 on 3D7 spans 1,918,029â€“2,038,340 (120,311bp in length) and chromosome 13 on 3D7 spans 2,792,022â€“2,925,236 (133,214bp in length).

The locations of exact matches between the Nanopore-assembled HB3 chromosome 13 and between the assembled chromosome 11 and the 3D7 11 and 13 chromosomes. The dark blue shaded region shows the location of the duplicated region between chromosomes 11 and 13. The assembled chromosome 13 matches the 3D7 chromosome 13 until this duplicated region and then more closely matches 3D7 chromosome 11 and its own chromosome 11. The figure begins at 50,000 bp before the duplicated region, but the new HB3 chromosome 11 matches 3D7 chromosome 11 for the rest of the beginning of the contig.
Figure 5â€”figure supplement 2: Annotation of HB3 chromosomes 11 and 13â€“11. The new Nanopore assembly of HB3 was annotated by Companion (Steinbiss et al., 2016), and the ends of chromosomes 11 and 13 are shown above. The duplicated region between chromosomes 11 and 13â€“11 is shown in blue under each chromosome, and the areas where HB3 chromosomes 11 and 13 have exact matches of at least 31 bp are labeled in red underneath. Exact matches of at least 31 bp to 3D7 chromosome 11 are shown in light blue. Both chromosomes end with telomere-associated repetitive elements (TARE), and both end with telomere-associated tandem repeat 1 (TARE1), which indicates that both assembled chromosomes reached the end of the telomere.
Figure 5â€”figure supplement 3: Annotation of SD01 chromosomes 11 and 13. The Nanopore assembly of SD01 was annotated by Companion (Steinbiss et al., 2016), and the ends of chromosomes 11 and 13 are shown above. The duplicated region between chromosomes 11 and 13 is shown in dark blue, and the areas where SD01 chromosomes 11 and 13 have exact matches of at least 31 bp are marked out in pink underneath. Exact matches of at least 31 bp to 3D7 chromosome 11 are shown in light blue. Due to the low quality of the input DNA of the SD01 parasite, the assembly of these chromosomes did not reach the end of the telomere, given that these assembled contigs did not contain telomere-associated repetitive elements (TARE). The assembly of these two chromosomes shows a high degree of similarity from the duplicated region to the end of the 13 associated contig (98.4% similarity with only 1428 difference over the 89,733 base region).
Figure 5â€”figure supplement 4: Chromosome 11/13 15.2 kb duplicated region for pfhrp3 deletion pattern 13-11++ parasites with identical chromosome 11 segment haplotypes. A subset of parasites from Figure 3â€”figure supplement 2 for the chromosome 11/13 duplicated region for the parasites with identical chromosome 11 segments based on their microhaplotypes. The leftmost column contains the groupings based on the microhaplotypes on chromosome 11. Several parasites have divergent copies of the 15.2 kb duplicated region despite the downstream chromosome 11 segments being a perfect copy. This would be consistent with the breakpoint for the duplication event within this region, where recombination occurred between nonidentical copies. The parasites are organized by the downstream duplicated chromosome 11 segment. For the 01, 03, 04, and 05 clusters, there are clear sub-clusters of haplotypes within this region consistent with separate duplication events creating the same downstream duplicated segment.
Figure 5â€”figure supplement 5: Whole genome IBD between pfhrp3 deletion pattern 13-11++ parasites. Whole genome identity by descent (IBD) was calculated between pfhrp3 deletion pattern 13-11++ parasites using hmmIBD using whole genome biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The fraction of sites in IBD between parasites was plotted above. The top and left side annotations are the same and contain the parasiteâ€™s country, region, and continent of origin. The annotation also has the deletion calls for pfhrp2/3 and which chromosome 11 haplotype cluster the parasite belongs to. Parasites clustered per continent of origin as expected, but there are different haplotype clusters per chromosome 11 duplicated clusters. When comparing the whole genome fraction of IBD sites, there are distinctive haplotype groups within the chromosome 11 haplotype cluster within the biggest clusters 01 (n=28) and 03 (n=12). The 01 cluster has three distinct groups, 03 cluster has five distinct groups. These groups are consistent with the distinct differences in the 15.2 kb duplicated region (the region with the breakpoint for the duplication) (see Figure 5â€”figure supplement 4), which would be consistent with different translocation events creating the same duplication segment of chromosome 11.
Figure 5â€”figure supplement 6: Genome coverage chromosome 8, 11, and 13 regions of isolates with subtelomere deletion of chromosome 11. Sequence coverage heatmap showing involved regions of chromosomes 11 (1,897,151â€“2,003,328 bp), 13 (2,769,916â€“2,844,785 bp), and 5 (944,389â€“988,747 bp) in the subset of the 19,313 parasites along with key lab isolates showing evidence of deletion of putative chromosome 11 subtelomere deletions. There are 41 parasites with evidence of chromosome 11 core genomic deletions. Each row is a parasite. The top annotation along chromosomes depicts the location of genes, and the second row delineates the duplicated region (dark blue) and subtelomere region (orange). The left parasite annotation includes the deletion pattern, continent of origin, and pfhrp2/3 deletion calls. There were 41 parasites with evidence of sub-telomeric chromosome 11 deletions, 38 of which contained TARE1 sequence where coverage drops to zero, which would be consistent with telomere healing. Only one parasite (lab isolate FCR3) had deletion up and through pf332 to the ribosomal duplicated region with subsequent duplication of chromosome 13 that would be consistent with the reciprocal of 13-11++. No field parasites had this pattern. The related clone of FCR3, IT, did not contain this pattern and would suggest that FCR3 duplicated this segment of chromosome 13 via translocation within the culture and not in the field. The top two parasites show evidence of both deleting chromosome 13 with duplication of chromosome 11 consistent with the 13-11++ pattern and have deleted a portion of the chromosome 11 genome with evidence of telomere-associated tandem repeat 1 (TARE1) healing on chromosome 11. An unusual pattern that is only observed for these two parasites and not for the other 13-11++ pattern parasites.
Figure 5â€”figure supplement 7: Windows of interest chromosomes 8, 11, 13. The chromosomes are mapped from the beginning of the regions of interest to the chromosomesâ€™ ends, with all genes/pseudogenes annotations shown as colored on top of the gray bars representing the chromosomes. From top to bottom, the regions are from 3D7 chromosomes 8 (1290239â€“1387982), 11 (1897151â€“2003328), and 13 (2769916â€“2844785), and each span to the end of their chromosome. The black bars on the bottom half of each chromosome are non-paralogous regions present in all strains, as described in the Methods section. The last black bar to the end of the gray bar represents the sub-telomeric regions that are not homologous between strains. The orange bars on top of the black bars are sub-regions where there is a variation that can be used to type the chromosomes. The light blue bars on top of the orange bars are the presence of biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The duplicated region between chromosomes 11 and 13 is shown (dark blue bars below chromosomes 11 and 13), as are the regions containing the pfhrp genes (lighter blue bars below chromosomes 8 and 13). The yellow (TARE3) and pink (telomere-associated tandem repeat 1, TARE1) bars on the bottom of the chromosomes represent the telomere-associated repetitive elements found at the end of chromosomes.

All genes/pseudogenes annotations are shown on top of the gray bars representing the chromosome region investigated (929384â€“988747). The first gene spans outside of this region and was shown to overhang this region, but the content underneath was not investigated. The black bars on the bottom half of each chromosome are non-paralogous regions present in all strains, as described in the Methods section. The orange bars on top of the black bars are sub-regions with variations that can be used to type the chromosome. The light blue bars on top of the orange bars are the presence of biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The pink bar shows the region that is duplicated in pattern 13-5++.
Figure 5â€”figure supplement 9: Chromosome 11 Duplicated Segment pfhrp3 deletion pattern 13-11++ parasites biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This plot was created and annotated the same way as Figure 2â€”figure supplement 4, but biallelic SNPs were used instead of small windows of microhaplotypes. The Chr11DupHapCluster is the same grouping as determined in Figure 2â€”figure supplement 4, and these clusters group together similarly when clustered by the biallelic SNPs.

This plot was created and annotated in the same way as Figure 2â€”figure supplement 3, but biallelic SNPs were used instead of small windows of microhaplotypes. The Chr11DupHapCluster is the same grouping as determined in Figure 2â€”figure supplement 3. Using biallelic SNPs created clustering that was very similar to that based on the microhaplotype windows.
Analysis of the 11 other PacBio assemblies (Otto et al., 2018a) with normal chromosome 11 showed that homology between strains also ended at this DnaJ gene (PF3D7_1149600) with the genes immediately following being within the stevor, rifin, and var gene families among other paralogous gene families. The genes on chromosome 13 deleted in the hybrid chromosome 13â€“11 corresponded to 3D7 genes PF3D7_1371500 through PF3D7_1373500 and include notably pfhrp3 and EBL-1 (PF3D7_1371600). The de-novo long-read assemblies of HB3 and SD01 further confirmed the presence of a normal chromosome 11 and hybrid chromosome 13â€“11 without other structural alterations.

Genomic refinement of breakpoint location for 13-11++
To better define the breakpoint, we examined microhaplotypes within the 15.2 kb ribosomal duplication for the 98 13-11++ parasites containing near-perfect chromosome 11 segments (Figure 2â€”figure supplement 1). Within each parasite, the microhaplotypes in the telomeric region are identical, consistent with a continuation of the adjacent chromosome 11 duplication. However, for nearly all parasites, as the region traverses towards the centromere within the ribosomal duplication, there is an abrupt transition where the haplotypes begin to differ. These transition points vary but are shared within specific groupings correlating with the chromosome 11 microhaplotype clusters (Figure 5â€”figure supplement 4). These transition points likely represent NAHR exchange breakpoints, and their varied locations further support that multiple intrastrain translocation events have given rise to 13-11++ parasites in the population. When comparing the whole genome fraction of IBD sites between these parasites, there are distinctive haplotype groups within the chromosome 11 haplotype clusters within the biggest clusters 01 (n=28) and 03 (n=12) (Figure 5â€”figure supplement 5). The 01 cluster has three distinct groups, 03 cluster has five distinct groups. These groups are consistent with the distinct differences in the 15.2 kb duplicated region (see Figure 5â€”figure supplement 4), which would be consistent with different translocation events creating the same duplication segment of chromosome 11.


DISCUSSION
Here, we used publicly available Illumina short-read and PacBio long-read from parasites across the world and newly generated Nanopore long-read sequencing data to identify pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions and their mechanisms in field P. falciparum parasites. The limited number of pfhrp2-deleted strains showed chromosome 8 breakpoints predominantly in the gene with evidence of telomere healing, a common repair mechanism in P. falciparum (Calhoun et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2014). We found that pfhrp3 deletions occurred through three different mechanisms. The least common mechanism involved simple breakage loss of chromosome 13 from pfhrp3 to the telomere, followed by telomere healing (13-TARE1 pattern). The second most common pattern 13-5++ was likely the result of NAHR, within 20â€“28 bp di-nucleotide AT repeats translocating a 26,535 bp region of chromosome 5 containing pfmdr1 onto chromosome 13, thereby duplicating pfmdr1 and deleting pfhrp3. There appeared to be one origin of 13-5++, which was only observed in the Asia population, and its continued presence was potentially driven by the added benefit of pfmdr1 duplication in the presence of mefloquine. The most common pattern, 13-11++, predominated in the Americas and Africa and was the result of NAHR between chromosome 11 and 13 within the large 15.2 kb highly-identical ribosomal duplication, translocating and thereby duplicating 70,175 bp of core chromosome 11 plus 15â€“87 kb of paralogous sub-telomeric region replacing the chromosomal region on chromosome 13 that contained pfhrp3. Importantly, NAHR-mediated translocations resulting in deletion have repeatedly occurred based on evidence of multiple breakpoints and chromosome 11 haplotypes with identical copies in parasites. These findings, combined with identical copies of the shared chromosome 11 segment, suggest that these parasites represent multiple instances of intrastrain (self) NAHR-mediated translocation followed by clonal propagation of 13-11++ progeny. Within haplotype groups with identical chromosome 11 duplicated regions, there appear to be several clonal groups, which suggests that different events lead to the same duplication of chromosome 11, and each continued to have clonal propagation (Figure 1â€”figure supplement 5). While Hinterberg et al. proposed that a general mechanism of non-homologous recombination of the subtelomeric regions may be responsible for translocating the already existing deletion of pfhrp3 (Hinterberg et al., 1994), our analysis would suggest ribosomal duplication-mediated NAHR is the likely cause of the pfhrp3 deletion itself. The high frequency of the meiotic translocation in the laboratory cross further supports the hypothesis that these NAHR-mediated translocations are occurring at a high frequency in meiosis in natural populations. Consequently, this suggests that progeny must be strongly selected against in natural populations apart from where specific conditions exist, allowing for pfhrp3 deletion to emerge and expand (e.g. South America and the Horn of Africa).
Positive selection due to drug resistance may underlie pattern 13-5++ translocation that duplicates pfmdr1 onto chromosome 13. In South East Asia (SEA), the only place containing pattern 13-5++, tandem duplications of pfmdr1 exist that provide mefloquine resistance, and mefloquine has been used extensively as an artemisinin partner drug, unlike Africa (Veiga et al., 2016). Discordant reads, local assembly, and TARE1 identification support NAHR-mediated translocation of pfmdr1, followed by telomeric healing to create a functional chromosome. All strains showed the same exact NAHR breakpoint and TARE1 localization consistent with a single origin event, giving rise to all 13-5++ parasites. Interestingly, pfmdr1 duplications have been shown to be unstable, with both increases and decreases in copy numbers frequently occurring (Samarakoon et al., 2011). During de-amplification, a free fragment of DNA containing a pfmdr1 copy may have been the substrate that integrated into chromosome 13 by NAHR, followed by telomerase healing to stabilize the 13â€“5 hybrid chromosome, analogous to var gene recombination events where double-stranded DNA is displaced, becoming highly recombinogenic (Zhang et al., 2019). The spread of 13-5++ containing parasites could be due to the benefit of the extra pfmdr1 copy on chromosome 13, the loss of pfhrp3, or both. Its expansion in SEA would be consistent with selection due to copy-number-associated mefloquine resistance, given mefloquineâ€™s extensive use as an individual and artemisinin partner drug in the region. Furthermore, given all isolates with evidence of this duplication either had only wild-type pfmdr1 or were mixed, the 13â€“5 chromosome copy most likely had wild-type pfmdr1. In 20 out of 25 pfmdr1 duplication cases with a mixed genotype of pfmdr1 (Figure 1â€”figure supplement 5), the core genome pfmdr1 had the Y184F mutation with no other mutations detected within the pfmdr1 gene. Isolates containing only Y184F in pfmdr1 were shown to be outgrown by wild-type pfmdr1 (Duvalsaint et al., 2021), which would mean having the wild-type pfmdr1 duplication on chromosome 13 might confer a stable (non-tandem) â€˜heterozygousâ€™ survival advantage beyond just increased copy number-mediated resistance to mefloquine.
To confirm the NAHR event between 11 and 13 leading to loss of pfhrp3 observed in our analysis of short-read data, we long-read sequenced pfhrp3 deleted lab isolates, HB3 and SD01, to generate reads spanning the 15 kb duplicated region, showing support for a normal chromosome 11 and a hybrid 13â€“11 in both isolates. These findings supported an NAHR event between the two 15 kb duplicated regions, causing this interchromosomal exchange and leading to progeny with a hybrid 13â€“11 chromosome lacking pfhrp3 and its surrounding genes from the 15 kb duplicated region and onwards (Figure 4 and Figure 5). This was consistent with the genomic coverage pattern we observed in publicly available data from 117 pfhrp3-deleted field samples (Figure 1). Such translocation patterns have been described and confirmed by long-read sequencing but have generally involved multigene families such as var genes within the subtelomeres (Calhoun et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019). The event described here represented a much larger section of loss/duplication of 70 kb of the core genome in addition to the subtelomere.
We propose a mechanistic model in which homology misalignment and recombination between chromosomes 11 and 13 initially occurs in an oocyst from identical parasites predominately in low transmission settings, resulting in four potential progeny including one with normal chromosomes 11 and 13 and three with translocations (Figure 6). This could account for the identical haplotypes observed in the two copies of the chromosome 11 segment. Based on the identical haplotypes observed in most parasites, the most direct and likely mechanism involves progeny with two copies of chromosome 11 recombining with an unrelated strain to yield unrelated chromosome 11 haplotypes. This duplication-mediated NAHR event occurs frequently during meiosis and can explain the frequent rearrangements seen between chromosomes 11 and 13 in the previous experimental cross of HB3 Ã— DD2 (Hinterberg et al., 1994). Meiotic misalignment and subsequent NAHR is a common cause of high-frequency chromosomal rearrangements, including in human disease (e.g. in humans, 22q11 deletion syndrome due to misalignment of duplicated blocks on chromosome 22 occurs in 1 in 4000 births)(VergÃ©s et al., 2014). This high frequency could explain why pfhrp3-deleted isolates are more common in many populations relative to pfhrp2(Feleke et al., 2021; GÃ³es et al., 2020; Vera-Arias et al., 2022), which likely requires infrequent random breaks along with rescue by telomere healing. In the future, more extensive sequencing of RDT-negative P. falciparum parasites is needed to confirm that no other deletion mechanisms are responsible for pfhrp2 loss.
Figure 6: Proposed model of duplication-mediated non-allelic homologous recombination during intrastrain meiotic recombination yielding 13-11++ parasites. Homology misalignment and non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between chromosomes 11 and 13 first occur in an oocyst formed from identical parasite gametes (intrastrain), which can then segregate, resulting in potential progeny (normal and three translocated progeny). Bold lines show the most direct path to a 13-11++ parasite containing a 13â€“11 hybrid chromosome lacking pfhrp3 and two identical copies of duplicated chromosome 11 segments seen predominantly. Subsequent recombination with an unrelated strain yields parasites with differing chromosome 11 duplication haplotypes but this can occur with subsequent interstrain meioses. Additionally, there is potential for balanced products, occurring with subsequent recombination events leading to pfhrp3 loss and either identical haplotypes (intrastrain) or different haplotypes (unrelated strain). Figure created using Biorender.
The lack of hybrid chromosome 13â€“11 (pattern 13-11++) worldwide suggests such events are normally quickly removed from the population due to fitness costs, an idea supported by recent in vitro competition studies in culture showing decreased fitness of pfhrp2/3-deleted parasites (Nair et al., 2022). This decreased fitness of parasites with pfhrp2/3 deletions also argues against a mitotic origin, as deletions arising after meiosis would have to compete against more numerous and more fit intact parasites. Additionally, pfhrp3 deletions arising in culture have not been observed. The fact that abundant pfhrp3 deletions have only been observed in low-transmission areas where within-infection competition is rare is consistent with this hypothesis of within-infection competition suppressing emergence. In the setting of RDT use in a low-transmission environment, a pfhrp2 deletion occurring in the context of an existing pfhrp3 deletion may be more strongly selected for compared to a pfhrp2 deletion occurring alone still detectable by RDTs. This is supported by evidence that pfhrp3 deletion appears to predate pfhrp2 deletions in the Horn of Africa (Feleke et al., 2021).
The biological effects of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 loss and potential selective forces are complicated due to other genes lost and gained and the extent of the rearrangements. Increased copies of genes on chromosome 11 could be beneficial, as pf332 on the chromosome 11 duplicated segment was found to be essential for binding the Maurer cleft to the erythrocyte skeleton and is highly expressed in patients with cerebral malaria (Bertin et al., 2016). Conversely, the lack of this protein is likely detrimental to survival and may be why the reciprocal hybrid 11â€“13 (pattern 13++11-) was not observed in field isolates. Only lab isolate FCR3 had any indication from coverage data that it had a duplicated chromosome 13 and a deleted chromosome 11. Furthermore, when looking at the field samples with chromosome 11 deletions with telomere healing, breakages were almost exclusively right after pf332 (Figure 5â€”figure supplement 6), which suggests this protein is vital. Given that the majority of the publicly available field samples were collected from studies using RDT-positive samples and that RDT would have likely detected the increased PfHRP3 encoded by duplicated pfhrp3, sampling should not be biased against detecting parasites with this reciprocal hybrid 11â€“13. Thus, the lack of 11â€“13 rearrangement in field isolates suggests that the selective disadvantage of the lost and gained genes was strong enough to prevent its emergence in the natural parasite population.
While further studies are needed to determine the reasons for these geographical patterns of pfhrp3 deletions, our results provide an improved understanding of the mechanism of structural variation underlying pfhrp3 deletion. They also suggest general constraints against emergence in high-transmission regions due to within-host competition and that there are likely further specific requirements for emergence in low-transmission settings. If selective constraints of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions are similar, the high frequency of the NAHR-mediated loss and the additional drug pressure from duplication of pfmdr1 may explain why pfhrp3 loss precedes pfhrp2 loss despite RDT pressure presumably exerting stronger survival advantage with loss of pfhrp2 versus pfhrp3. However, given we still have a limited understanding of their biological roles, there may be situations where selective forces may favor loss of pfhrp2 relative to pfhrp3. Limitations of this study include the use of publicly available sequencing data that were collected often based on positive rapid diagnostic tests, which limits our interpretation of the occurrence and relative frequency of these deletions. This could introduce regional biases due to different diagnostic methods as well as limit the full range of deletion mechanisms, particularly pfhrp2. Our findings are clinically important because the continued loss of these genes without timely intervention may result in a rapid decrease in the sensitivity of HRP2-based RDTs. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have performed long-read sequencing to definitively span and assemble the entire segmental duplication involved in the deletions. Future studies focused on these deletions, including representative sampling, are needed to determine the prevalence, interactions, and impacts of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions and the selective pressures and complex biology underlying them.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Genomic locations used
Conserved non-paralogous genomic regions surrounding pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 were determined to study the genomic deletions encompassing these genes. This was accomplished by first marking the 3D7 genome with the program tandem repeat finder (Benson, 1999), then taking 200 bp windows, stepping every 100 bp between these tandem repeats, and using LASTZ (Harris, 2007)(version 1.04.22) to align these regions against the reference genome 3D7 (version 3, 2015-06-18) and 10 currently available chromosomal-level PacBio assembled genomes (Otto et al., 2018a) that lacked pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions. Regions that aligned at &gt;70% identity in each genome only once were kept, and overlapping regions were then merged. Regions within the duplicated region on chromosome 11 and chromosome 13 were kept if they aligned to either chromosome 11 or 13 but not to other chromosomes. This region selection method decreases artifacts from multi-mapping and discordant reads. It allows analysis of only regions present in most strains, avoiding regions that may be absent from telomeric rearrangements. In this way, we have selected regions that can be reliably used to look for signals in coverage to detect copy number variation by minimizing the amount of contribution from artifacts from erroneous read mapping.

Whole genome sequencing analysis, assembly, read-depth analysis, and variant calling
Data was collected from all publicly available Illumina whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from global P. falciparum isolates as of January 2023, comprising 19,313 field samples of which 33 were lab isolates (Supplementary file 1). The majority of the data came from the Pf7 project (Abdel Hamid et al., 2023) but also included several smaller sequencing projects (Cerqueira et al., 2017; Dara et al., 2017; Feleke et al., 2021; LaVerriere et al., 2022; Mathieu et al., 2020; Melnikov et al., 2011; Parobek et al., 2017; Pelleau et al., 2015; Tvedte et al., 2021; Villena et al., 2021). Raw fastqs were downloaded using their short read archive (SRA) accession numbers. Using default settings, raw reads were trimmed with AdapterRemoval (Schubert et al., 2016). Processed reads were mapped to a genome file that was created by combining the human genome (GRCh38), mycoplasma genomes [Genbank accession AP014657.1 (Hata, 2015) and LR214940.1], and 3D7 Plasmodium falciparum (version 2015-06-18) genome with bwa-mem (Li, 2013) using settings of â€˜-M -k 25â€™ to optimize for contamination removal (Robinson et al., 2017). Reads that mapped to the human genome or mycoplasma genomes were removed to remove the human contamination from the field WGS data and to remove the mycoplasma contamination in the lab isolates. Filtered reads were then remapped to the 3D7 Plasmodium falciparum (version 2015-06-18) genome using the default settings of bwa-mem (Li, 2013).
Read depth for the above regions was then determined by taking the reads mapped to the region of interest and adjusting per-base read depth for read pairs (if both mates covered a specific base, its read coverage contribution was only 1 rather than 2). Read depth was then normalized by dividing by the median coverage of the whole genome. Read depth for the regions shared between chromosomes 11 and 13 was determined by taking reads mapped to the corresponding regions on 11 or 13 and then dividing by 2 to get the coverage for those regions. Samples were eliminated for downstream analysis if they had less than 5 x median genomic coverage and sWGA samples with significant variability on visible inspection. For most visualizations, the coverage is rounded to the nearest 1, and the max coverage is capped at 2 x coverage for better visualization. To ensure analysis of only highly confident deleted strains, normalized read depth between 0.1â€“1 was rounded to 1, and less than 0.1 was rounded to 0. Samples were considered for potential genomic deletion if they had zero coverage after rounding from chromosome 8 1,375,557â€“1,387,982 for pfhrp2, chromosome 13 from 2,841,776â€“2,844,785 for pfhrp3, and from chromosome 11 1,991,347â€“2,003,328. These numbers were chosen after visual inspection of samples with any zero coverage within the genomic region of pfhrp2/3. Looking for potential deletions by utilizing zero coverage limits detection of deletion only to monoclonal samples or mix-infection where all strains have deletions.
Variant calling was performed by GATK version 4.3.0 (Poplin et al., 2018), with default settings only on the non-paralogous regions, as determined above. Variants were then filtered to only biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The complexity of infection (COI) was determined using the REAL McCOIL (Chang et al., 2017) on the 1000 highest expected heterozygosity SNPs. Identity by descent was calculated using hmmIBD (Schaffner et al., 2018) to get inter-strain relatedness between samples.
Local haplotype reconstruction was also performed on each region described above on all the WGS samples using PathWeaver (https://github.com/nickjhathaway/PathWeaver copy archived at Hathaway, 2024 manuscript in preparation). PathWeaver takes the reads mapped to a region of interest and then performs a de Bruijn graph construction while keeping read information to inform graph traversal to prevent chimera assemblies in polyclonal samples. The haplotypes from PathWeaver were analyzed by constructing a graph for each genomic region to determine the conserved subregions that all haplotypes traversed using custom C++ scripts. Smaller variable regions were then determined to be those between these conserved regions. These variable subregions were used for genotyping by running PathWeaver again on these new regions. The regions analyzed were chromosome 05 (including pfmdr1): 929,384â€“988,747,, chromosome 08: 1,290,239â€“1,387,982, chromosome 11: 1,897,151â€“2,003,328, chromosome 13: 2,769,916â€“2,844,785 (Figure 5â€”figure supplement 7, Figure 5â€”figure supplement 8). To validate the PathWeaver results, we also analyzed these regions using the biallelic SNPs called by GATK as described above within the regions of interest (Supplementary file 4). The biallelic SNPs analysis produced similar results (Figure 5â€”figure supplement 9, Figure 5â€”figure supplement 10), and we opted to use the PathWeaver results as they give finer resolution by analyzing at a haplotype level rather than an SNP level. All coordinates in the manuscript are zero-based positioning relative to P. falciparum 3D7 genome version 3 (version = 2015-06-18) (Figure 5â€”figure supplement 7, Figure 5â€”figure supplement 8).

Tandem repeat associated element 1 (TARE1) analysis and telomere healing determination
The 7 bp pattern of TT[CT]AGGG (Vernick and McCutchan, 1988) was used to determine the presence of TARE1, of which the presence of this pattern was required to occur at least twice in tandem. To search for the presence of TARE1 within the short read Illumina WGS datasets, reads from the entire regions of interest were pulled down across chromosomes 5, 8, 11, and 13, and the above TARE1 pattern was searched for in each read. Regions with TARE1 detected in their reads were assembled to ensure the TARE1 sequence was contiguous with the genomic region from which the reads were pulled. The regions with TARE1 contiguous with genomic regions were then compared to the coverage pattern within the area. A parasite was marked as having evidence of telomere healing if TARE1 was detected in the regions where coverage then dropped to 0 or down to the genomic coverage of the rest of the genome in the case of the chromosome 5 duplication.

Chromosome 5 pfmdr1 duplication breakpoint determination
The recombination breakpoints on chromosome 5 were determined by looking for discordant read pairs (mates mapping to different chromosomal positions around areas of interest), assembling the discordant pairs, and mapping back to the assembled contig. Breakpoints were then determined by looking at the coordinates where a contig switches from one chromosomal region to the next. This was done by utilizing custom C++ scripts. The genomic regions where coverage had a sudden fold increase to 2 x or 3 x coverage were scanned in 500 bp windows, and discordant mates, as determined by their alignment by bwa, were gathered in each window. If a window had several discordant mates that mapped to within 500 bp of each other, these regions would be linked. Raw reads were then pulled from the original and discordant regions and assembled using PathWeaver. The assembled contigs were then aligned using LASTZ to determine where a contig switched from one chromosomal region (upstream for the tandem duplication or to a different chromosome like the chromosome 13 translocation) to determine the exact genomic locations of the breakpoints.

pfhrp3 pattern determination
A sample was considered pattern 13-11++ if it had zero coverage on chromosome 13 from the chromosome 11/13 duplicated region with no detectable TARE1 sequence at the location where coverage dropped to zero and if it had detectable coverage on chromosome 11 from the duplicated region onwards. Pattern 13-5++ was determined if a sample had discordant mates mapping from the region on chromosome 13, where that sample dropped to zero, to chromosome 5. Pattern 13-TARE1 was determined if a sample had a TARE1 sequence detected as contiguous with chromosome 13 sequence at the location on chromosome 13, where that sample dropped to zero.

Homologous genomic structure
To investigate the genomic landscape of recent segmental duplications across the genome and around pfhrp2 and pfhrp3, an all-by-all comparison of the 3D7 reference genome was performed by using the program nucmer and mummer (Kurtz et al., 2004). These programs align genomes by using unique kmers found within the genomes. To analyze the 3D7 reference genome, we separated the chromosomes into individual fasta files and used nucmer and mummer in an all-by-all comparison. Nucmer was run with the following commands: â€˜nucmer -mum -b 100 l 31 [CHROM_1].fasta [CHROM_2].fastaâ€™ and the following commands when comparing a chromosome against itself â€˜nucmer â€“reverse -mum -b 100 l 31 [CHROM_1].fasta [CHROM_1].fastaâ€™ to compare against only itâ€™s reverse complement. Mummer was run with the following commands: â€˜mummer -mum -b -c -F -l 31 [CHROM_1].fasta [CHROM_2].fastaâ€™ and when comparing a chromosome against itself â€˜mummer -mum -r -c -F -l 31 [CHROM_1].fasta [CHROM_1].fasta.â€™ The nucmer results can be found in Supplementary file 5.

Comparisons within Laverania
To investigate the origins of this region shared between chromosomes 11 and 13, the six closest relatives of Plasmodium falciparum within the Laverania subgenus with available assembled genomes were examined (Otto et al., 2018b). The genomes of all Laverania have recently been sequenced and assembled using PacBio and Illumina data (Otto et al., 2018b). The assemblies were analyzed using their annotations and LASTZ (Harris, 2007) with 80% identity and 90% coverage of the genes in the surrounding regions on chromosomes 5, 8, 11, and 13.

Long-read sequences
All PacBio reads for strains with known or suspected pfhrp3 deletions were obtained by SRA accession numbers from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI): HB3/Honduras (ERS712858) and SD01/Sudan (ERS746009)(Otto et al., 2018a). To supplement these reads and to improve upon previous assemblies that were unable to fully assemble chromosomes 11 and 13, we further sequenced these strains using Oxford Nanopore Technologiesâ€™ MinION device (Branton et al., 2008; Jain et al., 2016; Kasianowicz et al., 1996). The P. falciparum lab isolates HB3/Honduras (MRA-155) was obtained from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseasesâ€™ BEI Resources Repository. The field strain SD01/Sudan was obtained from the Department of Cellular and Applied Infection Biology at Rheinisch-WestfÃ¤lische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen University in Germany. Nanopore base-calling was done with Guppy version 5.0.7. Genome assemblies were performed with Canu (Koren et al., 2017), an assembly pipeline for high-noise single-molecule sequencing, and Flye (Kolmogorov et al., 2019) using default settings. To assemble the low coverage and highly similar chromosome 11 and 13 segments of SD01, two assemblies were performed with Flye using chromosome 13-specific and 11-specific reads to get contigs representing the chromosome 11 and 13 segments (Figure 4â€”figure supplement 2) and final contigs were polished using the Illumina SD01 reads using the program pilon (Walker et al., 2014). HB3 was assembled using the Canu assembler with default settings. Note that SD01 had a more disjointed assembly, likely due to coming from the last remaining cryopreserved vial, which had low parasitemia, was nonviable, and had a subsequent lower amount of input DNA. The PacBio/Nanopore reads were mapped to the 3D7 reference genome with hybrid chromosomes 11â€“13 and 13â€“11 using Minimap2 with default settings, a sequence alignment program (Li, 2018). Mappings to the duplicated region between chromosomes 11 and 13 were visualized using custom R scripts (Gu, 2022; R Development Core Team, 2022; Wickham et al., 2022). Reads were considered to be spanning the duplicated region if they extended at least 50 bp upstream and downstream from the duplicated region and if they mapped only to that one region. Non-spanning reads mapped to normal chromosomes 11 and 13 and the hybrid chromosomes as these genomic segments are identical.
